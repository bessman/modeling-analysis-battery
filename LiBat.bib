	abstract = {Galvanostatic measurements, made on spherical silverelectrodes in highly purified aqueous acidsolutions of silver perchlorate at current densities up to 10 amp cm—2, gave overpotential as a function of time and Faradaic current density at constant total current. Variables were total current density, concentration of silver ions and state of the electrodesurface. The theory of the surfacediffusion kinetics was developed to encompass high current density regions and the surface adion concentration (c ad 0) evaluated. A theoretical analysis of the steady state of surfacediffusion control of the metal‐ion exchange reaction shows that the current is distributed nonuniformly between growing sites, with constant potential over the electrodesurface. An equation previously developed by Rojter, Juza, and Polujan has been modified and shown to be applicable to galvanostatic transients when the transfer reaction is rate controlling. The symmetry factor β, of electrode kinetics, is shown to be potential dependent, and, in systems of sufficiently high i 0 values, to tend to zero at high overpotential. This results in a limiting current density for a transfer controlled process. The tendency towards such a current was observed and shown to be quantitatively consistent with the discussion of β.},

Partial least square ({PLS)} regression is used to evaluate electrochemical impedance spectra and predict state of charge. The impedance spectra are analysed in the frequency range 239–0.6 Hz. The impedance is measured for different states of charge at open-circuit conditions and during continuous discharge at loads ranging between 0.2 C and 0.8 C. When measuring the impedance during discharge, the {AC-current} signal is imposed on the {DC-current.} The predictive capability of the method is tested by a cross validation procedure and the root mean square error of prediction is 7\% when using the outlier identification capability of the {PLS-regression} method. The state of charge is evaluated with a single model, independently of whether the cell is subjected to open-circuit or polarised conditions. The predictive performance of the present model decreases at state of charge values less than 10\%.},

	abstract = {A number of advances in electrolytes have occurred in the past 4 years, which have contributed to increased safety, wider temperature range of operation, better cycling and other enhancements to lithium-ion batteries. The changes to basic electrolyte solutions that have occurred to accomplish these advances are discussed in detail. The solvent components that have led to better low-temperature operation are also considered. Also, additives that have resulted in better structure of the solid electrolyte interphase ({SEI)} are presented as well as proposed methods of operation of these additives. Other additives that have lessened the flammability of the electrolyte when exposed to air and also caused lowering of the heat of reaction with the oxidized positive electrode are discussed. Finally, additives that act to open current-interrupter devices by releasing a gas under overcharge conditions and those that act to cycle between electrodes to alleviate overcharging are presented. As a class, these new electrolytes are often called “functional electrolytes”. Possibilities for further progress in this most important area are presented.
Another area of active work in the recent past has been the reemergence of ambient-temperature molten salt electrolytes applied to alkali metal and lithium-ion batteries. This revival of an older field is due to the discovery of new salt types that have a higher voltage window (particularly to positive potentials) and also have greatly increased hydrolytic stability compared to previous ionic liquids. While practical batteries have not yet emerged from these studies, the increase in the number of active researchers and publications in the area demonstrates the interest and potentialities of the field. Progress in the field is briefly reviewed.
Finally, recent results on the mechanisms for capacity loss on shelf and cycling in lithium-ion cells are reviewed. Progress towards further market penetration by lithium-ion cells hinges on improved understanding of the failure mechanisms of the cells, so that crucial problems can be addressed.},

The lack of a serious challenge from other battery types has allowed lead–acid products to serve this market exclusively, with minimal demand for product improvement through research and development, and a sharp competition has, over time, cut sales prices to commodity levels. The electrochemical storage of energy in automobiles now faces the possibility of a major change, in the form of the proposed 36/42 V electrical systems for vehicles that remain primarily powered by internal combustion engines, and of the hybrid electric vehicle. The duty cycle for these two applications sees the battery held at a partial-state-of-charge ({PSoC)} for most of its life and required to supply, and to accept, charge at unprecedented rates. The remarkable advances achieved with {VRLA} battery technology for electric vehicles during the past 8–10 years will be of only passing value in overcoming the challenges posed by high rate {PSoC} service in 36/42 V and {HEV} duty. This is because the failure modes seen in {PSoC} are quite different from those faced in {EV} (deep cycle) use. The replacement of the 12 V {SLI} will not take place rapidly. However, if the applications which take its place are to be satisfied by a lead–acid product (probably {VRLA)}, rather than by a battery of a different chemistry, a program of development as successful as that mounted for deep cycle duty will be required. The present phase of the Advanced {Lead–Acid} Battery Consortium ({ALABC)} {R\&D} program has begun to shed light on those aspects of the function of a {VRLA} battery which currently limit its life in high rate {PSoC} duty. The program is also pursuing the several technologies which show promise of overcoming those limits, including multiple tab plate design, mass transport facilitation and minor component (both beneficial and detrimental impurity) management.
This paper presents a brief review of the changes which are taking place in lead–acid battery technology in response to the challenges of the new duty cycle.},

The thin film was comprised of micro/sub-microcrystalline Sn and {Cu6Sn5}, where the polyhedral micro-sized Sn grains were uniformly dispersed in the loose {Cu6Sn5} matrix. Lithiation reaction kinetics were confirmed to be controlled by a diffusion step and the diffusion coefficient of Li+ in the thin film anode was determined to be 1.91 × 10−7 cm2/s. The galvanostatic cycling behavior of {Sn/Cu6Sn5} composite thin film anodes was studied under different conditions. Stable capacities of more than 370 {mAh/g} were obtained by discharging from 1.25 to 0.1 V. Structure changes and fading mechanism of the thin film electrodes was discussed based on {SEM}, {XRD} and {EDX} investigations.

This paper presents an impedance based high frequency battery model derived from test results of a {NiMH} battery using a novel battery impedance tester. The possible reasons for the battery impedance characteristics in high frequency region, including skin effect and proximity effect, are also discussed. This battery model can be directly used in current ripple analysis, passive components design and control strategy optimization of power electronic circuits. The effect of the passive component values on the battery current ripple is analyzed using the ac equivalent circuit of the test setup.},

This attribute is exactly the major function of the battery-management system ({BMS)-to} check and control the status of battery within their specified safe operating conditions. In this paper, a typical {BMS} block diagram has been proposed using various functional blocks. The state of charge ({SOC)} estimation has been implemented using Coulomb counting and open-circuit voltage methods, thereby eliminating the limitation of the stand-alone Coulomb counting method. By modeling the battery with {SOC} as one of the state variables, {SOC} can be estimated, which is further corrected by the Kalman filtering method. The battery parameters from experimental results are integrated in the model, and simulation results are validated by experiment.},

The charged (4.2 V) and uncharged (3.7 V) 18650 Li-ion batteries are tested using a {VSP2} with a customized stainless steel test can to evaluate their thermal hazard characteristics, such as the initial exothermic temperature (T0), the self-heating rate ({dT/dt)}, the pressure rise rate ({dP/dt)}, the pressure–temperature profiles and the maximum temperature (Tmax) and pressure (Pmax). The Tmax and Pmax of the charged Li-ion battery during the runaway reaction reach 903.0 {°C} and 1565.9 psig (pound-force per square inch gauge), respectively. This result leads to a thermal explosion, and the heat of reaction is 26.2 {kJ.} The thermokinetic parameters of the reaction of {LiCoO2} batteries are also determined using the Arrhenius model. The thermal reaction mechanism of the Li-ion battery (pack) proved to be an important safety concern for energy storage. Additionally, use of the {VSP2} to classify the self-reactive ratings of the various Li-ion batteries demonstrates a new application of the adiabatic calorimetric methodology.},

The study shows that at moderate lithiation rates, 100 {mA} g−1, most of the carbon fibers display a reversible capacity close to or above 100 {mAh} g−1 after ten full cycles. For most of the fibers, removing the sizing increased the capacity to some extent. However, the main factor affecting the measured capacity was the lithiation rate. Decreasing the current by a tenth yielded an increase of capacity of around 100\% for all the tested grades. From the measurements performed in this study it is evident that carbon fibers can be used as the active negative material and current collector in structural batteries.},

Lead-acid battery is modeled in the first order R-C model by {MATLAB/Simulink} and battery parameters are measured by the pulsed current and constant current discharge test. The battery is connected to the three-phase interleaved dc-dc converter in order for reduction of ripple current to 8\% from 32.5\%, increase of battery lifetime and reduction of total size of inductors. The ripple current is further reduced to 2\% from 8\% by connecting a filter capacitor and design rule of filter capacitor is analyzed. The controller for charging and discharging mode is designed and the proposed reduction methods of battery ripple currents are verified in a {5kW} charger.},

	abstract = {Primary lithium batteries contain hazardous materials such as lithium metal and flammable solvents, which can lead to exothermic activity and runaway reactions above a defined temperature. Lithium-ion batteries operating outside the safe envelope can also lead to formation of lithium metal and thermal runaway. Despite protection by battery safety mechanisms, fires originating from primary lithium and lithium-ion batteries are a relatively frequent occurrence.
This paper reviews the hazards associated with primary lithium and lithium-ion cells, with an emphasis on the role played by chemistry at individual cell level. Safety mechanisms to prevent the occurrence and limit the consequences of incidents are reviewed, together with safety tests to monitor compliance with battery safety regulations and standards. Incident information from news accounts and open literature sources are reviewed to extract causal information.
It is concluded that the potential severity of incidents during storage, transport and recycling of waste batteries can be significantly higher than in end-use applications. Safe storage, packaging and labelling practices, as well as communication among the parties involved, are essential to ensure safety across the battery lifecycle. It is recommended that a database of lithium battery incidents would be valuable to improve the evidence base for informing accident prevention measures.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries have become the focus of research interest, thanks to their numerous benefits for vehicle applications. One main limitation of these technologies resides in the battery ageing. The effects of battery ageing limit its performance and occur throughout their whole life, whether the battery is used or not, which is a major drawback on real usage. Furthermore, degradations take place in every condition, but in different proportions as usage and external conditions interact to provoke degradations. The ageing phenomena are highly complicated to characterize due to the factors cross-dependence. This paper reviews various aspects of recent research and developments, from different fields, on lithium-ion battery ageing mechanisms and estimations. In this paper is presented a summary of techniques, models and algorithms used for battery ageing estimation ({SOH}, {RUL)}, going from a detailed electrochemical approach to statistical methods based on data. In order to present the accuracy of currently used methods, their respective characteristics are discussed. Remaining challenges are deeply detailed, along with a discussion about the ideal method resulting from existing methods.},

	title = {Impact of Current Ripple on Li-Ion Battery Ageing},
	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of the current ripple, originating from the dc-dc
converter of e.g. a {PHEV} powertrain, on the ageing of Li-ion batteries. Most research concerning
batteries focuses on very low ({μHz)} to low (Hz) frequencies and low current ripples to create very
accurate battery models which can determine e.g. the State of Charge of the battery. On the other
hand the design of dc-dc converters tries to reduce the current ripple by using multiple phases with
interleaving technique and capacitors in parallel with the battery. The interaction between the current
ripple of the dc-dc converter and the battery has received little attention so far. A test set-up is build with
two identical 304 V , 12 {kW} h Li-ion batteries and two 100 A dc-dc converters. The dc-dc converter
can be connected to an {LCL-filter} or solely to the primary inductor of this filter, such that the battery
current contains a small or large current ripple respectively. The batteries are discharged and charged
to simulate the circumstances in which a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle is used. After each month,
during which the battery either experiences a small or large current ripple, characterization tests are
performed to establisch the ageing of the batteries. Based on the test results, the current ripple does
not appear to have a measurable impact on the battery resistance and the Discharge and Regen Power.
There is an increase of the resistance and a decrease of the Discharge and Regen Power, but this is
to be expected as the battery packs are submitted to 3 months of Combined Cycle Life Testing. The
temperature of the battery turns out to be far more important for the resistance and attained power levels
of the batteries. The absent effect of the current ripple on the ageing of the batteries may be due to the
intrinsic double-layer capacitor. This capacitor at the surface of the electrodes carries part of the current
ripple and reduces the current ripple as experienced by the actual charge transfer reaction which carries
the dc-part of the current.},

This study looked at the charge acceptance and maximum discharge ability of a valve regulated lead acid ({VRLA)} and a Li-ion battery connected in parallel to supercapacitors. The test procedure evaluated the advantage of using a supercapacitor at a 2 F:1 Ah ratio with the battery types at various states of charge ({SoC).} The results showed that about 7\% of extra charge was achieved over a 5-s test time for a Li-ion hybrid system at 20\% {SoC}, whereas at the 80\% {SoC} the additional capacity was approximately 16\%. While for the {VRLA} battery hybrid system, an additional charge of up to 20\% was achieved when the battery was at 80\% {SoC}, with little or no benefit at the 20\% {SoC.} The advantage of the supercapacitor in parallel with a {VRLA} battery was noticeable on its discharge ability, where significant extra capacity was achieved for short periods of time for a battery at the 60\% and 40\% {SoC} when compared to the Li-ion hybrid system. The study also made use of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy ({EIS)} with a suitable equivalent circuit model to explain, in particular, the internal resistance and capacitance differences observed between the different battery chemistries with and without a supercapacitor.},

If aging at elevated temperature would only be faster, but in all other respects equivalent to aging at ambient temperature, cells aged to end-of-life ({EOL)} at different temperatures would be very similar. The present study compares {graphite/LiFePO4-based} cells either cycle- or calendar-aged to {EOL} at 22 {°C} and 55 {°C.} Cells cycled at the two temperatures show differences in electrochemical impedance spectra as well as in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ({XPS)} spectra. These results show that lithium-ion cell aging is a complex set of processes. At elevated temperature, the aging is accelerated in process-specific ways. Furthermore, the {XPS} results of cycle-aged samples indicate increased deposition of oxygenated {LiPF6} decomposition products in both the negative and positive electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The decomposition seems more pronounced at elevated temperature, and largely accelerated by cycling, which could contribute to the observed cell impedance increase.},

It was established that calendar aging has negligible effect on cell impedance, while cycle aging increases the impedance mainly due to structural changes in the {LiFePO4} porous electrode and electrolyte decomposition products on both electrodes.

Presently, this capacity is obtained by the periodic discharge of the cell fully but this can introduce damage to the cell and shorten its lifespan. In this work, an electrical model is developed for {LiB} cells based on the principle of electrochemistry from its discharge curve (i.e. the change in terminal voltage over time within a discharge cycle). This model is able to compute the internal parameters of a cell, including its maximum initial capacity at the beginning of each discharge cycle. With the internal parameters computed, it can also produce its Nyquist plot and the plot is found to agree well with its experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ({EIS)} spectra. With this model, the status of a {LiB} cell and its maximum charge capacity can be determined in real time.},

The model includes electrochemical impedance due to charge-transfer reaction, diffusion dynamics in the electrodes, effects of ion concentration, capacitance dispersion in the double layer, and anode insulating film growth, etc. The impedance tests for model validation were performed on two lithium-ion cells at ambient temperature and at different {SOC} levels. A particle swarm optimization method is employed to identify model parameters. The model accuracy under different conditions is compared with that of conventional Randles model and the parameter variations at different stage of the aging process are studied.},
